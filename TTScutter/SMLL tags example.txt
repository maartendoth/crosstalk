Here are some features to use while generating speech:
Add a break
Mary had a little lamb <break time="1s"/> Whose fleece was white as snow.
Emphasizing words
I already told you I <emphasis level="strong">really like </emphasis> that person.
Speed
For dramatic purposes, you might wish to <prosody rate="slow">slow down the speaking rate of your text.</prosody>
Or if you are in a hurry <prosody rate="fast">your may want to speed it up a bit.</prosody>
Pitch
Do you like sythesized speech <prosody pitch="high">with a pitch that is higher than normal?</prosody>
Or do you prefer your speech <prosody pitch="-20%">with a somewhat lower pitch?</prosody>
Whisper
<amazon:effect name="whispered">If you make any noise, </amazon:effect> she said, <amazon:effect name="whispered">they will hear us.</amazon:effect>
Conversations
It is possible to switch between speakers within the text. Just use the following format:
[speaker:Brian] Hello Emma
[speaker:Emma] Hey Brian
[speaker:Brian] How are you doing?
[speaker:Emma] I am fine. May i invite you to a cup of tea?

Please note: Remove any diacritical signs from the speakers names when using this, Léa = Lea, Penélope = Penelope
